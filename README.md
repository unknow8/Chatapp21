# Abstract: 
ChatApp21 is an online chat website matching pairs of random users to connect with each other to exchange informative news, interesting facts on a daily basis. Users can sign up, login quickly through their Google account along with personalizing their profile. After the small talk, they can add friends to enable private chat, form a group chat by inviting other users either by searching for a username or by providing a link to access. Users can also use voice chat and emojis. Rather than reading long news, people bring informative facts/news to others through communication form. The purpose of this chat app is for everyone to feel comfortable talking and exchange information with other strangers on a daily basis.
 
# How is this problem solved currently?
Currently, social networking apps such as Facebook do great work to provide a convenient platform connecting people with plenty of prominent features such as private chat/group chat, share user information and their status among the community. However, people usually need to have real-life relationships to connect and "being friends" on Facebook to access full features.
On the side of gaining valuable information, Quora and Reddit are mainstream platforms for “ask me anything” purposes, people can ask and get a lot of useful information in different fields. However, those platforms focus on informative purposes rather than connection and communication between people.
With ChatApp21, people can get information in an enjoyable way, maintain small talk with strangers, and exchange interesting information happening around the world in a day. The good side of our ChatApp21 is that not only we focus on exchanging informative facts/news in a day but also simple ways to connect users.
